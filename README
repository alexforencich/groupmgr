groupmgr
========

_groupmgr_ is a simple group manager plugin for dokuwiki.  It allows easy
modification of group membership by non-admins.  Configured properly, it
simplifies management of collaborative projects.

Installation
------------

Unzip into lib/plugins directory

Syntax
------

Syntax:
~~GROUPMGR|[groups to manage]|[allowed users and groups]~~

Examples
--------

~~GROUPMGR|posters|@moderators~~
Members of group 'posters' can be managed by group 'moderators'

~~GROUPMGR|groupa, groupb|joe, @admin~~
Members of 'groupa' and 'groupb' can be managed by user 'joe'
and members of the group 'admin'

Notes:

1. Super user groups can only be managed by super users
2. forbidden_groups configuration setting specifies groups that cannot be
   edited with the plugin
3. Users cannot remove themselves from the group that grants them access
   to the group manager (including admins)
4. The conf_namespace option specifies a separate namespace for configuration.
   When the config namespace is used, a placeholder tag (~~GROUPMGR~~) can be
   used in the actual page while the full tag is placed in the configuration
   namespace at config_namespace:ID
5. If require_conf_namespace is set, all configuration options placed in the
   page are ignored, necesitating the use of the configuration namespace.
   For security reasons, this is the default configuration.
